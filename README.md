# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. It leverages the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101) and a pre-trained ResNet18 model to help users track dietary intake and make informed food choices.
